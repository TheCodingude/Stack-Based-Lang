# STACK BASED LANG


not really that special, its just a stack based langauge <br>
(it's kind of bad) <br>
(it also doesnt have a name)





## CODE SAMPLES:


### pushing numbers to the stack:
```
push 30
push 70
```

as of right now it also pushes any number on to the stack with or with out the "push" keyword, like this:
```
70
```
<hr>

### popping number from the stack:
<br>
popping a number removes it from the stack and makes it avaliable to use

```
pop , 
```
using the "pop" keyword to pop a value of the stack then using the "," symbol to print to the standard output

<hr>

### peeking on the top of the stack:

<br>

peeking allows you to use a number but not remove it from the stack
```
peek ,
```

<hr>

### MATH:

the language supports addition, subraction, multiplication, divison, and exponents. done like this:
```forth
34 35 +    //addition
80 11 -    //subtraction
7 3 *      //multiplication
21 3 /     //division
3 3 ^      //exponent
```
